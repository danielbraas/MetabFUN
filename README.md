# MetabFUN

## The scope of this package
This package is developed to provide functions that are useful for metabolomics data analysis. This includes data manipulation, statistical calculations and graphical outputs.
  
I will add functions to this package as I go. Many of those functions currently exist only in script form on a local drive and will be made publically available as soon as possible.
